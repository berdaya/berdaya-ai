*"When does a man die? When he is hit by a bullet? No! When he suffers from a disease? No! When he eats a soup made from poisonous mushrooms? No! A man dies when he is forgotten!"*  
– Dr. Hiluluk

Legends like Queen, The Beatles, and Avicii have left behind legacies that ensure they are remembered long after their passing. This got me thinking: **What can I contribute to the world so that I won’t be forgotten?**

## The Power of Reflection

What if we asked ourselves 10-20 meaningful questions every day and meticulously documented our answers? Questions that help us understand ourselves better—questions that we revisit and refine throughout our lives. Over time, these responses would paint a detailed picture of who we are.

## Creating a Digital Essence

Now imagine using this data to fine-tune an AI model, creating a digital essence of ourselves. This model could preserve our thoughts, opinions, and wisdom, allowing others—our children, grandchildren, or even strangers—to seek our perspective long after we are gone.

## Preserving Knowledge for the Future

Every individual carries unique experiences and insights that deserve to be preserved. Humanity has forgotten how to build the pyramids, losing the wisdom of ancient minds. We shouldn’t let that happen again. By preserving our voices through technology, we can transcend the boundaries of time, ensuring that the wisdom of today becomes the guiding light for generations yet to come.
